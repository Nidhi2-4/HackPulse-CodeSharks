"""The two models that use numbers instead of the X-ray. Not called by the backend yet.

    low_muscle(...)  sarcopenia_ANN_1.joblib        chance of low muscle mass
    bone_loss(...)   osteoporosis_XGBoost_1.joblib  chance of osteopenia or osteoporosis

Both were trained on NHANES (US survey; see ml/training/build_nhanes_dataset.py). The muscle model
saw ages 20 to 59 only. Weight files are in models/models/ and the team's Drive, not in git.

Needs: scikit-learn 1.6.1, xgboost, joblib, pandas, h5py, numpy 2.
Check it runs: python -m ml.tabular
